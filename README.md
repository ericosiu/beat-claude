# Beat Claude

**The hiring challenge for AI-native professionals**

Single Grain is looking for strategists who can think better than AI.

## How It Works

1. Pick a challenge from [`/challenges`](challenges/)
2. Read the brief
3. Submit your answer
4. We compare it to Claude's answer (blind review)
5. If you beat Claude → we want to talk

## Why This Exists

AI can do 80% of knowledge work now. We need people who can do the 20% that AI can't: creative leaps, pattern recognition, judgment under uncertainty.

If you can't beat Claude on a strategy challenge, you're competing with a $20/month tool. We're looking for people who make AI look basic.

## The Rules

Use whatever tools you want. AI, research, friends, whatever.

The baseline answer was generated by Claude using the same brief you're seeing. If you just paste this into an AI, you'll get roughly the same answer we already have. That means you tie. **Ties don't advance.**

To beat Claude, you need to add something it couldn't.
