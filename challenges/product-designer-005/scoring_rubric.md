## Hints for What Beats Claude

Claude's baseline answer is solid UX thinking but predictable:
- Standard "remove friction" approach
- Template-based onboarding
- Progressive disclosure pattern

**To beat it, you might:**
- Propose a more radical restructuring
- Show deeper understanding of agency workflow
- Include actual UI designs, not just wireframes
- Demonstrate specific copy/microcopy expertise
- Propose A/B testing strategy
- Show how to measure "aha moment" precisely
- Include edge cases (mobile, different roles, different agency sizes)

**Claude's answer tends to be:**
- Correct but could be for any B2B SaaS
- Missing agency-specific insights
- Generic wireframes

The bar to beat is "good UX generalist." To win, show us you understand agencies and have redesigned onboarding flows before.
