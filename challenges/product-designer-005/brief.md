## Redesign: B2B Onboarding Flow with 60% Drop-off

### The Situation

You're joining a B2B SaaS company as a senior product designer. The company's onboarding flow has a critical drop-off problem.

**Company Context**
- Series A project management tool for agencies ($8M raised)
- Target: Creative agencies (10-100 employees)
- Current users: 2,000 teams
- Team: 1 PM, 2 engineers, 1 designer (you)

**Current Onboarding Problem**
- Sign-up to "first value" conversion: 40% (industry avg: 65%)
- 60% of users drop off before completing setup
- Average time to complete onboarding: 12 minutes
- Support tickets about onboarding: 35% of all tickets

**Current Flow (5 steps)**
1. Account creation (email, password, company name)
2. Team setup (invite 3+ teammates)
3. Integration setup (connect Slack, Google, Figma)
4. First project creation (template or blank)
5. Tutorial walkthrough (5-minute interactive guide)

**Drop-off Data**
| Step | Start | Complete | Drop-off |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1. Account creation | 100% | 95% | 5% |
| 2. Team setup | 95% | 52% | 43% |
| 3. Integration setup | 52% | 41% | 11% |
| 4. First project | 41% | 38% | 3% |
| 5. Tutorial | 38% | 40%* | +2%* |

*Some users skip to tutorial directly

**User Research Highlights**
- "I just wanted to try it myself first before inviting my team"
- "The integrations step felt overwhelming—too many options"
- "I didn't understand why I needed to create a project to see the tool"
- "The tutorial was actually helpful but I almost didn't get there"

**Business Constraints**
- Team invites are critical for virality (30% of new signups come from invites)
- Integrations drive retention (users with 2+ integrations have 3x better retention)
- Engineering capacity: 1 sprint (2 weeks) for V1 improvements

### Your Task

**Redesign the onboarding experience** to improve sign-up to first-value conversion from 40% to 60%+.

### What to Submit

Your redesign should include:

1. **Problem Analysis**
   - What's actually causing the 60% drop-off?
   - Which steps need the most attention?
   - What assumptions are baked into the current flow?

2. **Redesigned Flow**
   - New step-by-step flow (with wireframes or detailed descriptions)
   - How do you handle the team invite step?
   - How do you preserve integration adoption without blocking?

3. **Key Design Decisions**
   - What did you add, remove, or change?
   - Why will this improve conversion?
   - What trade-offs are you making?

4. **Progressive Disclosure Strategy**
   - How do you get users to value faster?
   - When do you ask for team invites?
   - How do you reintroduce "skipped" steps later?

5. **Success Metrics**
   - How would you measure if this works?
   - What leading indicators would you track?
   - How long before you'd know if it's working?

6. **V1 Scope (2-week sprint)**
   - What's the minimum viable improvement?
   - What would you cut if engineering says it's too much?
   - What's the phased rollout plan?

### Deliverable Format

- Wireframes (low or high fidelity, your choice)
- Written rationale for each major decision
- Can use Figma, Sketch, or even hand-drawn + photos
