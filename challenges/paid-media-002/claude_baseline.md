## Paid Media Scaling Plan: $50K → $200K/mo

### Executive Summary

Scaling 4x in paid spend requires systematic expansion across proven channels while testing new ones. The key risk is CAC degradation as you exhaust high-intent audiences. My approach: deepen Google (highest intent), expand LinkedIn strategically, and test YouTube/programmatic for upper-funnel.

**6-Month Goal:** $200K/mo spend at ≤$1,500 CAC = ~133 demos/mo from paid (up from ~100 currently)

## 1. Channel Strategy

### Month 6 Target Allocation

| Channel | Current | Target | % of Budget | Rationale |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Google Ads | $30K | $90K | 45% | Highest intent, most scalable via keyword expansion |
| LinkedIn | $15K | $60K | 30% | Best B2B targeting, but CPCs will rise |
| YouTube | $0 | $25K | 12.5% | Upper-funnel awareness, retargeting |
| Meta | $5K | $15K | 7.5% | Retargeting only, not cold |
| Programmatic | $0 | $10K | 5% | Industry publications, contextual |

### New Channels to Test

1. **YouTube** (Month 2): Construction industry content is underserved. Target users watching Procore tutorials, construction management content.

2. **Programmatic/Trade Pubs** (Month 3): Construction Executive, ENR, Building Design + Construction have digital inventory.

3. **Reddit** (Month 4): r/construction, r/projectmanagement have engaged audiences. Low CPCs but requires authentic approach.

### What I'd Avoid

- TikTok (audience mismatch)
- Twitter/X (low B2B intent for this vertical)
- Podcast ads (hard to measure, premature at this stage)

---

## 2. Campaign Architecture

### Google Ads Structure

**Search Campaigns:**
- Brand (protect and expand)
- Competitor (Procore alternatives, Buildertrend vs, etc.)
- High-intent keywords (construction project management software, construction scheduling tool)
- Problem-aware (construction delays, project timeline management)

**Display/YouTube:**
- Retargeting site visitors (7, 30, 90 day windows)
- Customer match lookalikes
- In-market: Construction & Building Materials

### LinkedIn Structure

**Campaign Types:**
- Sponsored Content (thought leadership + direct response)
- Conversation Ads (for high-value accounts)
- Document Ads (case studies, ROI calculators)

**Audience Segmentation:**
- Job titles: Project Manager, Construction Manager, VP Operations
- Company size: 50-500 employees
- Industry: Construction, Architecture, Engineering
- Seniority: Manager+

**ABM Layer:**
- Upload target account list (top 500 construction companies)
- Matched audience campaigns with higher bids

### Creative Strategy

- **Hero asset:** Customer case study video (2-3 min)
- **Social proof:** Logos, testimonials, G2 reviews
- **Educational:** "The hidden cost of construction delays" angle
- **Demo:** Product walkthrough showing AI scheduling
- **Refresh cadence:** New creative every 4-6 weeks per channel

## 4. Measurement Framework

### Metrics by Funnel Stage

| Stage | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Top | Impressions, CPM, CTR | CTR > 1% |
| Middle | Demo requests, Cost per demo | < $500 |
| Bottom | MQL → Opp rate, CAC | 40% conversion, < $1,500 CAC |
| Revenue | Pipeline generated, Closed won | Track by cohort |

### Attribution Model

- **Primary:** Last-touch with 90-day lookback
- **Secondary:** Linear multi-touch for budget allocation insights
- **Tools:** HubSpot attribution + Google Analytics 4 + LinkedIn Insight Tag

### Testing Methodology

- Minimum $2K spend per test before decision
- 2-week minimum test duration
- Document winner/loser with reasoning
- A/B test creative (not audiences) first

## 5. Risk Mitigation

### CAC Degradation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Audience saturation on LinkedIn | Expand targeting, refresh creative, test new formats |
| Google CPC increases | Expand to long-tail keywords, improve Quality Score |
| Creative fatigue | Monthly refresh cadence, build creative backlog |
| Seasonal slowdown (Q2-Q3) | Shift budget to brand/upper-funnel, reduce spend targets |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Team bandwidth | Hire freelancer Month 1, evaluate agency Month 3 |
| Attribution gaps | Implement UTM discipline, offline conversion import |
| Budget pacing | Weekly reviews, automated rules for overspend |

---

## 6. Budget Breakdown

### Month 6 Full Budget ($200K)

| Category | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Media spend | $175K | 87.5% of budget |
| Agency/freelance | $15K | Management + creative production |
| Tools | $5K | Analytics, creative tools, ABM platform |
| Contingency | $5K | Testing new channels |

### Expected CAC Progression

| Spend Level | Expected CAC | Demos/Month | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| $50K (current) | $1,200 | ~100 | Baseline |
| $100K | $1,300 | ~180 | Some efficiency loss expected |
| $150K | $1,400 | ~250 | Approaching ceiling |
| $200K | $1,450-1,500 | ~320 | At target CAC limit |

### CAC Sensitivity

If CAC trends above $1,500:
1. Pause lowest-performing channels
2. Shift budget to retargeting (lower CAC)
3. Reduce spend growth rate
4. Evaluate creative quality

---

## Summary

This plan scales spend 4x over 6 months by:

1. **Deepening Google** (45% of budget) — highest intent, most headroom
2. **Expanding LinkedIn strategically** (30%) — better targeting, ABM layer
3. **Adding YouTube** (12.5%) — upper-funnel awareness and retargeting
4. **Testing programmatic** (5%) — industry-specific placements

The main risk is CAC degradation as you scale. Mitigation: aggressive creative refresh, expand to new audiences before saturation, and ruthless pausing of underperformers.

Headcount/agency support is critical — the current team cannot manage 4x spend without help.
