- Integrates with Procore, Autodesk, and other construction software

**Market Context**
- TAM: ~15,000 construction companies in target segment (US)
- 3 main competitors with larger marketing budgets
- Seasonal: Q1 and Q4 are strongest (project planning cycles)

### Your Task

Create a **paid media scaling plan** to go from $50K/mo to $200K/mo spend over 6 months while maintaining or improving CAC efficiency.

### What to Submit

Your plan should include:

1. **Channel Strategy & Campaign Architecture**
   - How do you allocate the increased budget across channels? What new channels (if any) would you test?
   - What campaign types and structures for each channel? How do you segment audiences? Creative strategy?

2. **Scaling Roadmap & Budget Breakdown**
   - Month-by-month spend progression with key milestones and decision points
   - Detailed allocation: media spend, tools, creative, headcount
   - Expected CAC at $100K, $150K, and $200K spend levels
   - When do you add headcount vs. agency vs. tools?

3. **Measurement & Risk Mitigation**
   - What metrics do you track at each stage of the funnel? How do you attribute revenue to paid channels?
   - What could cause CAC to blow up as you scale? How do you maintain creative freshness?

### Constraints

- Current team is maxed out at $50K spend
- Leadership expects CAC to stay under $1,500
- Cannot hire full-time for 90 days (budget freeze)
- Must maintain brand guidelines (no aggressive/salesy creative)
