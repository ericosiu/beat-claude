# Scoring Rubric: Ops COO 009

This challenge-specific rubric supplements the [general scoring methodology](../../SCORING.md).

## Challenge-Specific Evaluation Points

### Operational Judgment (30 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Triage instinct — acts on the right fire first with clear reasoning
- Understands the difference between urgent and important
- Makes decisions with incomplete information rather than waiting for perfect data
- Shows pattern recognition from real operational experience

**Red flags:**
- First 48 hours starts with "schedule meetings with stakeholders"
- Treats all 23 queue items equally instead of triaging
- Prioritizes the queue backlog over the ClickFlow churn (process over revenue)
- Can't articulate why they'd handle fires in a specific order

### AI Fluency (25 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Treats AI agents as a workforce to manage, not tools to configure
- Evaluates agent output by business outcomes, not technical metrics
- Understands the feedback loop: agent output → human judgment → agent improvement
- Shows real experience managing automated systems (not theoretical)

**Red flags:**
- Part 4 AI Edge section is generic ("I use ChatGPT for writing")
- Can't describe how to evaluate AI output without being a domain expert
- Treats the agent system as "engineering's problem"
- No before/after metrics on their personal AI workflow

### Complexity Reduction (20 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Elon Algorithm audit kills at least 2 crons with clear reasoning
- Risk tiering system is simple enough to explain in 2 minutes
- Doesn't add new tools, dashboards, or processes without killing old ones
- Recognizes that the 48-cron system is probably too many, not too few

**Red flags:**
- Audit keeps all 8 sample crons running
- Suggests adding new monitoring layers on top of existing system
- Risk tiering has 5+ tiers or a decision matrix with 20+ criteria
- "We need to build a new dashboard for..." as a first instinct

**Bonus points for:**
- Candidate who kills 3+ crons from the sample
- Risk tier decision tree that's genuinely implementable (not just conceptual)
- Explicitly says "we have too many crons" and proposes a target number

### Specificity (15 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Hour-by-hour first 48 hours, not "Day 1: learn the system"
- Risk tiers with named examples in each tier
- Elon Algorithm audit has a verdict for each of the 8 sample crons
- The 30-minute Eric block has a specific agenda, not "alignment"

**Red flags:**
- "Assess the situation and develop a plan" without specifying what the plan is
- Risk tiers described conceptually but no specific items placed in each tier
- Elon Algorithm uses generic "evaluate ROI" framework without applying it
- Missing any of the four parts entirely

### Communication (10 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Scannable — uses tables, bullets, headers
- Gets to the point fast — diagnosis before solution, then action
- Respects the 2-page limit without feeling cramped
- Writes like someone who sends "Done" messages, not "Working on it" messages

**Red flags:**
- Long preambles before getting to the plan
- Excessive use of frameworks and acronyms
- Reads like a consulting deck (polished but hollow)
- Over 2 pages

## Hints for What Beats Claude

Claude's baseline answer is structured and methodical:
- Clean triage logic with reasonable fire prioritization
- Standard risk tiering system with green/yellow/red
- Balanced audit that kills 2 crons and improves 3
- Honest admission that it can't provide real AI workflow experience

**To beat it, you might:**
- Show triage instinct that comes from pattern recognition, not logic trees (you've seen this fire before and know which ones spread fastest)
- Design a risk tiering system with non-obvious criteria — things Claude wouldn't think to include because it's never run an approval queue
- Kill more crons and be comfortable with the discomfort of removing things people built
- Give a real AI workflow example with actual numbers — Claude literally cannot do this
- Show CEO management instinct — how to protect Eric's time while pushing back when needed, from real experience managing visionary founders
- Demonstrate that your first 48 hours includes picking up the phone, not just working through the dashboard

**The human advantage on this challenge:**
- Part 1 (Triage): Real operators know which fires are recoverable and which aren't — that instinct comes from experience, not analysis
- Part 2 (Risk Tiering): The hardest part isn't the framework — it's knowing where the auto-approve boundary should be, which requires having made the wrong call before
- Part 3 (Elon Algorithm): Claude will be balanced and diplomatic about killing crons. A great candidate will be decisive and slightly aggressive — they know that keeping things alive has a cost
- Part 4 (Operating Edge): Claude will admit it has no personal experience. The operational experience questions (process enforcement, keeping trains running) are where real COOs/GMs shine — you can't fake "I enforced a cadence that people hated at first." The MMPI adds a self-awareness dimension Claude can't replicate.

### LinkedIn & Background (Evaluated Separately)

**What we're looking for:**
- Long tenure at companies (not a job-hopper)
- Track record of promotions — ideally at 2+ companies (multiple organizations invested in their growth)
- COO, GM, VP Ops, or Head of Ops titles in their history
- Evidence of running operations, not just advising on them

**Red flags:**
- Average tenure under 18 months across roles
- No promotions visible — lateral moves only
- LinkedIn is sparse or unverifiable
- No operational titles in work history
