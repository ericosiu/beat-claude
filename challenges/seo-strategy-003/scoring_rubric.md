## Hints for What Beats Claude

Claude's baseline answer is comprehensive but formulaic:
- Standard content tiering approach
- Generic Core Web Vitals fixes
- Textbook link building tactics

**To beat it, you might:**
- Show deeper diagnostic thinking (what specifically about Google updates hit this site?)
- Propose a more aggressive consolidation strategy (400 posts may be 200 too many)
- Demonstrate fintech-specific SEO knowledge
- Include specific refresh examples with before/after
- Show link building creativity beyond guest posting
- Challenge the "compete with Ramp" framing

**Claude's answer tends to be:**
- Correct but could apply to any site
- Conservative on pruning decisions
- Missing fintech-specific opportunities

The bar to beat is "competent SEO generalist." To win, show us you've recovered traffic for similar sites and understand the fintech content landscape.
