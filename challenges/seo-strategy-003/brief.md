## SEO Turnaround for a Declining Fintech Blog

### The Situation

You're advising a fintech company whose organic traffic has declined 40% over the past 12 months. Here's what you know:

**Company Snapshot**

- ARR: $30M
- Team: 1 Content Manager, 1 SEO Specialist, access to freelance writers
- Reports to: VP of Marketing

**Current SEO State**

- Indexed pages: 800+
- Blog posts: 400+ articles (published over 5 years)
- Keywords ranking: 12,000 (down from 18,000)

**Traffic Breakdown**
- Blog: 70% of organic traffic
- Product pages: 15%
- Comparison pages: 10%
- Other: 5%

**Top Performing Content (historically)**
- "What is expense management" (was #1, now #4)

- "Corporate card vs credit card" (was #3, now #5)
- Several posts have dropped off page 1 entirely

- Many posts are 3-5 years old with outdated information
- Site speed: 3.2s LCP (poor)
- Core Web Vitals: Failing on mobile
- Internal linking: Inconsistent
- Competitor Ramp published 50 new posts in past 6 months and is outranking on key terms

**Resources**
- Budget: $15K/mo for SEO (content, tools, contractors)
- Current tools: Ahrefs, Clearscope, WordPress
- Writers: 3 freelancers at $300/post

### Your Task

Create a **12-month SEO recovery plan** to get back to 140K organic traffic/mo and improve conversion from organic visitors.

### What to Submit

Your plan should include:

1. **Diagnostic Analysis & Competitive Response**
   - What's causing the traffic decline? How do you prioritize what to fix?
   - How do you respond to Ramp's content push? Which battles do you fight vs. avoid?

2. **Content & Technical Strategy**
   - What do you do with 400+ existing posts? How do you prioritize refresh vs. new?
   - How do you address Core Web Vitals and technical fixes?
   - What's your link building approach on a $15K/mo budget?

3. **12-Month Roadmap**
   - Quarter-by-quarter priorities with key milestones and metrics
   - Team/resource allocation
   - What does success look like at 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months?

### Constraints

- Cannot hire full-time for 6 months
- Engineering resources limited (1 sprint/quarter for SEO fixes)
- Must maintain publishing cadence (4 posts/month minimum)
- Leadership wants to see traction in 90 days
