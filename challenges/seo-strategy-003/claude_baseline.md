## 12-Month SEO Recovery Plan

### Executive Summary

A 40% traffic decline with 400+ aging posts and failing Core Web Vitals points to content decay and technical debt. The fix: aggressive content refresh, technical remediation, and strategic new content to defend against Ramp.

**12-Month Goal:** Return to 140K/mo organic traffic with improved conversion rate

---

## 1. Diagnostic Analysis

### Likely Causes of Decline

| Factor | Evidence | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Content decay | Top posts dropped 3-5 positions | High |
| Core Web Vitals failure | 3.2s LCP, failing mobile | High |
| Competitor surge | Ramp published 50 posts in 6 months | Medium |
| Thin/outdated content | 400+ posts, no audit in 18 months | Medium |
| Algorithm updates | Google's helpful content updates | Medium |

### Priority Framework

1. **Quick wins:** Fix what's already ranking and slipping
2. **Technical foundation:** Core Web Vitals before content push
3. **Competitive defense:** Protect high-value keywords
4. **Growth:** New content after foundation is solid

### Data I'd Want

- Google Search Console: Query-level click/impression trends
- GA4: Conversion rates by landing page
- Ahrefs: Keyword position changes over 12 months
- Content inventory: Last updated date, word count, backlinks per post
- Competitor analysis: Ramp's top-performing new content

---

## 2. Content Strategy

### Existing Content (400+ posts)

**Tier 1: Refresh Priority (Top 50 posts)**
- Posts ranking positions 4-20 with high impressions
- Previously top performers that slipped
- Action: Full refresh with updated data, expanded sections, new internal links

**Tier 2: Consolidate (100-150 posts)**
- Multiple posts targeting similar keywords
- Thin content (<800 words) on same topics
- Action: Merge into comprehensive guides, redirect old URLs

**Tier 3: Prune (100-200 posts)**
- Zero traffic for 12+ months
- Outdated topics (e.g., "COVID expense policies 2020")
- Action: Noindex or 301 to relevant content

**Tier 4: Maintain (remaining)**
- Steady traffic, no urgent issues
- Action: Light refresh annually

### New Content Strategy

**Monthly Output:**
- 2 refreshes (Tier 1 posts)
- 2 new posts (gap-filling and competitive response)
- 1 consolidation project (Tier 2)

**Content Types to Prioritize:**
- Comparison pages ("Ramp vs [Brand]", "Brex vs [Brand]")
- BOFU guides ("How to choose expense management software")
- Data-driven content (original research, benchmarks)
- Integration content (QuickBooks + [Brand], Netsuite + [Brand])

### Refresh Playbook

For each Tier 1 refresh:
1. Update all statistics and examples
2. Add 2024/2025 context
3. Expand thin sections based on SERP analysis
4. Add schema markup (FAQ, HowTo)
5. Improve internal linking (5+ contextual links)
6. Update meta title/description
7. Add/update visuals

## 3. Technical SEO

### Core Web Vitals (Priority 1)

| Metric | Current | Target | Fix |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| LCP | 3.2s | <2.5s | Image optimization, lazy loading, CDN |
| FID/INP | Unknown | <200ms | Defer non-critical JS |
| CLS | Unknown | <0.1 | Reserve space for images/ads |

**Sprint 1 Request (Q1):**
- Implement image CDN or optimize images
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Add explicit width/height to images
- Preload critical fonts

### Other Technical Fixes

| Issue | Priority | Effort |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Internal linking cleanup | High | Medium |
| Orphan page identification | Medium | Low |
| XML sitemap optimization | Medium | Low |
| Canonical tag audit | Medium | Low |
| Mobile UX improvements | High | High |

### Crawl Efficiency

- Remove low-value pages from sitemap
- Add noindex to tag/category archives
- Fix redirect chains (if any)
- Improve pagination handling

---

## 4. Competitive Response

### Ramp Assessment

Ramp published 50 posts in 6 months = aggressive content push. Likely strategy: capture informational queries, build topical authority, support paid acquisition.

### Response Strategy

**Don't:** Try to out-publish Ramp post-for-post

**Do:**
1. **Defend core keywords:** Aggressively refresh your best content
2. **Go deeper:** Make your top 20 posts the definitive resource
3. **Differentiate:** Focus on integration content (Ramp can't cover your integrations)
4. **Counter-position:** Comparison pages where you win on specific features

### Battles to Fight

| Keyword Type | Strategy |
|--------------|----------|
| Your #1-3 rankings | Defend aggressively |
| Position 4-10 with high volume | Refresh to reclaim |
| Ramp's new rankings | Only if high-intent |
| Generic informational | Let go, not worth the fight |

### Battles to Avoid

- Generic terms where Ramp has momentum
- Topics outside your product expertise
- Content requiring resources you don't have

## 5. Link Building

### Budget Allocation ($15K/mo total SEO budget)

| Category | Monthly | Notes |

- Target: 3-5 links/month

**Tier 3: Resource Link Building ($500/mo)**

---

## Summary

This recovery plan focuses on:

1. **Fixing the foundation first** — Core Web Vitals and technical debt before content scaling
2. **Refreshing over creating** — More ROI in updating 50 existing posts than writing 50 new ones
3. **Strategic pruning** — 400 posts is too many; consolidate and remove low performers
4. **Defending, not chasing** — Protect your rankings instead of trying to out-publish Ramp
5. **Sustainable link building** — Original research + guest posting within budget

The 90-day leadership ask is achievable if you show: Core Web Vitals fixed, top 5 keywords stabilized, and traffic decline flattened. Full recovery takes 12 months.
