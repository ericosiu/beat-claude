# Challenge: Talent Manager 008

## AI-Enabled Talent Strategy for a Scaling Marketing Agency

### The Situation

You're being hired as the **Senior Talent Manager** at Single Grain, a digital marketing agency in transition. The company is shifting from a traditional agency model to a tech-enabled services (TES) model, and the CEO has declared "hire great people" as one of only 3 company priorities for the year.

The problem: the talent function is understaffed, mostly reactive, and not using AI at all. You're being brought in to build a modern, AI-powered talent engine from scratch.

**Company Snapshot**
- ~60 employees across marketing, engineering, operations, and leadership
- Revenue: mid-eight figures, growing
- Clients include Fortune 500 companies and venture-backed startups
- CEO Eric Siu is publicly vocal about AI adoption—the company runs on Claude Code, AI agents, and automation internally
- Hybrid/remote team, primarily US-based
- Agency margins mean every bad hire is expensive (estimated $50K-150K per mis-hire including ramp time, lost clients, and backfill)

**Current Hiring State**
- 5-8 open roles at any given time across departments (engineering, paid media, SEO, content, account management)
- No dedicated recruiter—hiring is done by department heads + a fractional HR consultant
- Average time-to-fill: 45-60 days
- Candidate pipeline is thin: mostly inbound from job boards and occasional LinkedIn outreach
- Offer acceptance rate: ~65% (too low)
- 90-day new hire retention: ~75% (should be 90%+)
- No structured onboarding beyond "here's your laptop and Slack"
- No employer brand strategy—candidates don't know what it's like to work at Single Grain
- The company has a unique hiring test called "Beat Claude" where candidates compete against AI on strategy challenges

**The AI Mandate**
- Eric expects every function to be AI-forward. "If you're not using AI in your workflow, you're already behind"
- The company internally uses Claude Code, custom AI agents, automated workflows, and AI-assisted decision-making
- Talent candidates who can't demonstrate AI fluency are a poor culture fit
- The talent function itself should model AI-native work—use AI for sourcing, screening, scheduling, onboarding, and retention analytics

**Competitive Context**
- Competing for talent against: other agencies (Wpromote, Directive, Power Digital), in-house teams at tech companies, and fully remote startups
- Single Grain's advantages: AI-forward culture, CEO with public brand, interesting clients, growth trajectory
- Single Grain's disadvantages: agency pay scales (can't match FAANG), smaller brand than mega-agencies, fast-paced environment isn't for everyone

### Your Task

Create a **comprehensive AI-enabled talent strategy** that demonstrates three things:

1. **Your AI Thinking** — How would you use AI tools across the entire talent lifecycle? Don't just say "use AI for resume screening." Show us the actual workflow. What do you automate? What stays human? Where does AI create unfair advantages in recruiting?

2. **Your Talent Strategy Thinking** — Show depth on employer branding, sourcing, assessment, onboarding, and retention. We don't want a generic HR playbook—we want a strategy built for a fast-growing, AI-native agency.

3. **Your Specific Plan for Single Grain** — This isn't abstract. You know the company, the culture, the "Beat Claude" hiring test, the CEO's public profile. What would you actually do in the first 90 days?

### What to Submit

Your strategy should include:

1. **Talent Audit & Diagnosis**
   - What's working in the current setup?
   - What's broken or missing?
   - What's the single highest-leverage fix?

2. **AI-Powered Talent Workflow**
   - Map the full talent lifecycle: sourcing → screening → interviewing → offer → onboarding → retention
   - Where does AI fit at each stage? Be specific about tools, prompts, and workflows
   - What must remain human and why?
   - How do you avoid AI bias in hiring decisions?

3. **Sourcing & Employer Brand Strategy**
   - How do you build a pipeline that doesn't rely on job board pray-and-spray?
   - How do you leverage Eric's personal brand and content for recruiting?
   - What does the employer brand look like? What story are you telling candidates?
   - How do you source for AI-native talent specifically?

4. **Assessment & Selection**
   - How do you evaluate candidates beyond resumes and interviews?
   - How does "Beat Claude" fit into the broader assessment strategy?
   - What's your interview process design? How many rounds, who's involved, what are you testing at each stage?
   - How do you improve the 65% offer acceptance rate?

5. **Onboarding & Retention**
   - Design a 30/60/90 onboarding program
   - How do you get new hires productive faster using AI?
   - What early warning systems do you build for retention risk?
   - How do you create a culture where top talent wants to stay at an agency (notoriously high-turnover industry)?

6. **Metrics & 90-Day Milestones**
   - What KPIs define success for the talent function?
   - What should be true at Day 30, 60, and 90?
   - How do you report talent health to the CEO?

### Constraints

- Budget: You have one headcount (yourself) + $3K/month for tools and job board spend
- You don't have an ATS yet—you need to recommend and implement one
- Department heads are busy and can give ~2-3 hours/week to hiring activities
- The CEO wants to see measurable improvement within 90 days
- Agency culture means speed matters—roles that stay open too long cost real revenue (unfilled seats = clients underserved)
- You must balance speed with quality—fast hires that churn in 90 days are worse than slow hires that stay

### Evaluation Criteria

See [SCORING.md](../../SCORING.md) for how submissions are evaluated.

Your answer will be compared against Claude's answer to this same brief in a blind review.

**This challenge specifically weights:**
- AI Fluency (20 pts) — We want to see a genuinely AI-native talent workflow, not AI as an afterthought
- Strategic Depth (30 pts) — Talent strategy for a scaling agency has real constraints. Show you understand them
- Specificity (25 pts) — Name the ATS. Describe the onboarding schedule. Write the outreach message. Could we execute this tomorrow?

### Format

Submit as PDF or Markdown. No length requirement—be as concise or detailed as the strategy demands.
