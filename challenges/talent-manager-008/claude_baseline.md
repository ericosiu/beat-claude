## AI-Enabled Talent Strategy for Single Grain

### Executive Summary

Single Grain's talent function is running on willpower—department heads squeezing hiring into their spare hours, no systems, no employer brand, no pipeline. That's normal for a 60-person agency. What's not normal is that this company already runs on AI internally but applies none of it to how they find and keep people. The fix is straightforward: build an AI-native talent engine that treats recruiting like a pipeline problem (because it is one), while making Single Grain's AI-forward culture the centerpiece of the employer brand.

**90-Day Goal:** Reduce time-to-fill from 45-60 days to 30 days, increase offer acceptance to 80%+, and implement a structured onboarding program that pushes 90-day retention above 90%.

## 1. Talent Audit & Diagnosis

### What's Working
- **"Beat Claude" is brilliant.** A public hiring challenge that doubles as marketing is rare. It self-selects for AI-fluent, competitive candidates—exactly who Single Grain needs
- **Eric's personal brand is an asset.** 187K YouTube subscribers, a top podcast, active LinkedIn. Most agencies have zero founder visibility. This is a recruiting advantage that's being wasted
- **Real clients and real work.** Amazon, Uber, Salesforce—this is a credibility signal that matters to candidates
- **AI-native culture.** Running on Claude Code, building AI agents internally—this is genuinely differentiated and attractive to a specific (valuable) talent pool

### What's Broken
- **No owner = no system.** Hiring by committee with department heads means nobody owns the pipeline, candidate experience is inconsistent, and follow-ups fall through cracks
- **No ATS = no data.** You can't improve what you can't measure. Without an ATS, every hire is a one-off
- **Thin pipeline.** Relying on inbound from job boards means you're fishing in the same pond as everyone else
- **65% offer acceptance is a red flag.** This means either: offers are too low, the process is too slow (candidates accept elsewhere), or the candidate experience is bad. Probably all three
- **Onboarding is a gap.** "Here's your laptop" means new hires take months to ramp instead of weeks. In an agency where every unfilled/unproductive seat costs revenue, this is expensive
- **No employer brand.** Candidates can't answer "what's it like to work at Single Grain?" because nobody's telling that story

### Single Highest-Leverage Fix
**Implement an ATS and AI-assisted sourcing pipeline.** Everything else (employer brand, better onboarding, retention tracking) depends on having a system to build on. Without infrastructure, every improvement is manual and fragile.

## 2. AI-Powered Talent Workflow

### Full Lifecycle Map

| Stage | AI Tool/Approach | What It Does | Human Role |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Job Description** | Claude | Generate role descriptions from bullet-point inputs, ensure inclusive language, create multiple versions for different channels | Hiring manager approves, adds role-specific nuance |
| **Sourcing** | Claude + LinkedIn Recruiter + Gem | AI identifies passive candidates matching criteria, writes personalized outreach messages based on candidate's profile/content | Recruiter reviews and sends, makes relationship decisions |
| **Resume Screening** | Claude + ATS scoring | Score resumes against weighted criteria, flag standouts and clear mismatches, surface non-obvious candidates | Recruiter makes borderline calls, checks for bias |
| **Outreach** | Claude + email sequences | Draft personalized messages at scale, A/B test subject lines, automate follow-ups | Recruiter personalizes final touch |
| **Scheduling** | Calendly + Zapier | Auto-schedule interviews based on availability, send prep materials | Coordinator manages exceptions |
| **Interview Prep** | Claude | Generate role-specific interview questions, create candidate briefing docs from LinkedIn/portfolio | Interviewers bring human judgment |
| **Assessment** | Beat Claude challenge | Objective, blind evaluation of strategic thinking | Reviewer scores and compares |
| **Debrief** | Claude | Aggregate interviewer scorecards, flag consensus/disagreements, generate candidate summary | Hiring manager makes final call |
| **Offer** | Claude + comp data | Draft offer letters, model comp scenarios, personalize based on candidate priorities | Recruiter negotiates, builds relationship |
| **Onboarding** | Claude + Notion/Slackbot | Auto-generate onboarding checklists per role, create personalized learning paths, schedule check-ins | Manager provides context, culture, and relationship |
| **Retention** | Claude + Lattice/15Five | Analyze engagement survey data, flag attrition risk signals, suggest intervention strategies | Manager has 1:1 conversations, addresses root causes |

### What Must Stay Human
- **Final hiring decisions.** AI can rank and recommend, but a human must make the call—especially for culture fit and long-term potential
- **Candidate relationship.** The emotional intelligence of recruiting (reading hesitation, selling the vision, negotiating with empathy) is human work
- **Interview conversations.** AI can generate questions, but the back-and-forth of an interview—probing deeper, reading body language, building rapport—requires a person
- **Onboarding relationships.** A Slackbot can deliver information, but a new hire needs a human who genuinely cares about their success
- **Retention conversations.** When someone is thinking about leaving, they need a human who listens, not an algorithm that flags them

### Avoiding AI Bias
- **Audit AI screening criteria quarterly.** Check for proxy discrimination (school names, zip codes, gendered language patterns)
- **Never let AI be the sole decision-maker.** AI scores are an input, not a verdict
- **Diverse calibration sets.** When training any scoring criteria, ensure the baseline includes diverse candidates
- **Blind the "Beat Claude" review.** Already designed this way—keep it
- **Regular adverse impact analysis.** Track pass-through rates by demographic at each stage

## 3. Sourcing & Employer Brand Strategy

### Pipeline Building (Beyond Job Boards)

**Tier 1: High-Intent Channels**
- **Beat Claude (public challenge):** Market it harder—this should be the primary top-of-funnel. Promote on Eric's channels, LinkedIn, and relevant communities. Every challenge submission is a warm lead
- **Eric's content audience:** Add "we're hiring" CTAs to podcast, YouTube, and newsletter. People who already follow Eric are pre-sold on the culture
- **Employee referrals:** Launch a referral program ($2K-5K per hire, paid at 90-day mark). Employees' networks are the highest-quality source

**Tier 2: Targeted Outbound**
- **LinkedIn Recruiter + AI outreach:** Use Claude to write personalized messages based on candidates' recent posts, projects, or content. Not "I came across your profile"—actual personalization that shows you read their work
- **Community sourcing:** AI/marketing Slack communities, indie hacker forums, Superpath (content marketers), Demand Curve, and agency-specific communities
- **Conference/event talent spotting:** Identify speakers at marketing and AI conferences—they're already demonstrating expertise publicly

**Tier 3: Long-Term Brand**
- **"Day in the Life" content:** Short videos showing how the team uses AI, what projects look like, how Eric interacts with the team. Publish on YouTube and LinkedIn
- **Open-source hiring:** The "Beat Claude" repo itself is employer branding. Continue adding challenges, publish leaderboard updates, and let it grow organically
- **Glassdoor/LinkedIn presence:** Actively manage reviews and company page with current photos, culture content, and team highlights

### Sourcing AI-Native Talent Specifically
- Look for candidates who **build in public**: personal projects using AI, Twitter/LinkedIn posts about AI workflows, open-source contributions
- "Beat Claude" inherently filters for this—anyone who can't use AI strategically won't score well
- In outreach, lead with the AI culture: "We're a marketing agency that runs on Claude Code and AI agents. Most of our team uses AI daily. Interested?"

## 4. Assessment & Selection

### Interview Process (4 Stages, ~2 Weeks)

**Stage 1: Application + AI Screen (Day 1-3)**
- Candidate applies or is sourced
- AI scores resume against weighted criteria (skills match, experience level, career trajectory)
- Top 30% advance automatically. Bottom 50% declined. Middle 20% human-reviewed
- Time from candidate: 15 min (application)

**Stage 2: Beat Claude Challenge (Day 3-7)**
- Candidate receives role-specific challenge
- Submits within 5 days
- Blind-scored against Claude's baseline
- Top scorers advance
- Time from candidate: 2-4 hours

**Stage 3: Hiring Manager Interview (Day 7-10)**
- 45-minute conversation focused on:
  - Walk through their Beat Claude submission (reasoning, not just the answer)
  - AI workflow demonstration: "Show me how you'd use AI to solve [role-specific task]"
  - Culture and work style alignment
- Time from candidate: 45 min

**Stage 4: Team Fit + Exec Chat (Day 10-14)**
- 30-minute conversation with 1-2 future teammates (peer assessment)
- 15-minute chat with Eric (for senior roles) or department head
- Focus: Would I want to work alongside this person? Do they raise the bar?
- Time from candidate: 45 min

**Total candidate time commitment: ~5-6 hours across 2 weeks**

### Improving Offer Acceptance (65% → 80%+)

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Process too slow (candidates accept elsewhere) | Target 14-day process. If you can't move fast, you lose to companies that can |
| Comp below expectations | Research market rates for each role. If you can't match base salary, lead with total comp story (equity/bonuses, AI tools, growth trajectory, interesting clients) |
| Candidate doesn't feel wanted | Make offers over a call, not email. Personalize why you want *them* specifically. Have Eric send a personal note for senior hires |
| Unclear role/expectations | Send a detailed "your first 90 days" doc with the offer. Reduce ambiguity |
| Competing offers | Move to verbal offer within 24 hours of final interview. Speed is a weapon |

## 5. Onboarding & Retention

### 30/60/90 Onboarding Program

**Pre-Day 1 (Offer → Start Date)**
- Welcome package: personalized email from Eric, team intro doc, "what to expect Week 1" guide
- Hardware/software shipped and configured
- Slack channels pre-joined, calendar populated with onboarding sessions
- Assign an onboarding buddy (peer, not manager)

**Week 1: Orientation + Context**
- Day 1: Company overview with Eric (recorded, AI-generated summary shared after), tool setup, meet the team
- Day 2-3: Department deep-dive, current client overview, AI tools training (Claude Code, internal agents)
- Day 4-5: Shadow 2-3 team members on actual client work
- Deliverable: New hire writes a 1-page "what I've learned" doc (forces active processing)

**Days 8-30: Ramp**
- Own a small project or task immediately (learning by doing > training decks)
- Weekly 1:1 with manager (structured: what's going well, what's confusing, what do you need?)
- AI workflow setup: get them using Claude for their role-specific tasks within Week 2
- Day 30 check-in: Manager + new hire review progress against expectations. Written feedback both ways

**Days 31-60: Independence**
- Take ownership of a full workstream or client
- Reduce check-in frequency to biweekly
- Join a cross-functional project to build relationships outside their team
- Day 60 check-in: Are they on track? Any concerns? Adjust if needed

**Days 61-90: Full Integration**
- Operating independently with normal supervision
- Contributing to team meetings and strategy
- Day 90 review: Formal assessment. Are they meeting expectations? Would we hire them again knowing what we know now?
- Decision point: confirm, extend probation, or part ways

### Getting New Hires Productive Faster with AI
- **Role-specific AI starter kit:** Pre-built Claude prompts, templates, and workflows for their specific role (e.g., an SEO hire gets prompt templates for keyword research, content briefs, competitor analysis)
- **AI-generated onboarding guide:** Claude creates a personalized learning path based on the hire's background and role requirements
- **Institutional knowledge bot:** Feed company docs, processes, and FAQs into a Claude-powered Slack bot that answers "how do we do X?" questions instantly
- **Meeting summary digests:** AI summarizes all team meetings for the first 30 days so new hires get context without attending everything

### Retention Early Warning System
- **Quarterly pulse surveys** analyzed by AI for sentiment trends (not just averages—look for individual declines)
- **Manager 1:1 quality tracking:** AI reviews 1:1 notes for patterns (are concerns being raised? are they being addressed?)
- **Tenure milestone check-ins:** Proactive conversations at 6 months, 1 year (the highest-risk departure points for agencies)
- **Comp benchmarking:** Quarterly AI-assisted market rate checks. Don't let retention become a comp problem

### Agency-Specific Retention Strategies
- **Career pathing:** Show clear progression from individual contributor → senior → lead → director. Agencies lose people who can't see a future
- **Client variety:** Rotate team members across accounts to prevent burnout and stagnation
- **Learning budget:** $1K/year per person for courses, conferences, or tools. Small investment, big signal
- **AI upskilling:** Regular internal workshops on new AI tools and workflows. Position Single Grain as the place where you become AI-fluent (valuable skill they take with them—but ironically, that makes them want to stay)

## Summary

Single Grain's talent challenge is a systems problem, not a people problem. The ingredients are there—interesting work, AI-forward culture, strong founder brand, and the Beat Claude differentiator. What's missing is infrastructure (ATS, onboarding, pipeline) and a dedicated owner who builds AI into every step.

The strategy prioritizes three things:
1. **Build the machine** (ATS, process, templates) so hiring isn't heroic effort every time
2. **Activate existing assets** (Eric's brand, Beat Claude, employee networks) instead of throwing money at job boards
3. **AI-enable everything** that doesn't require human judgment, so one talent manager can operate at the capacity of a 3-person team

The 90-day plan is designed around quick wins that compound: each improvement (faster process, better sourcing, structured onboarding) makes the next hire better than the last.
