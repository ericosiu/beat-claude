# Scoring Rubric: Talent Manager 008

This challenge-specific rubric supplements the [general scoring methodology](../../SCORING.md).

## Challenge-Specific Evaluation Points

### Strategic Depth (30 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Understands that agency talent is a fundamentally different problem than tech company talent (high turnover industry, margin pressure, client-facing roles, pace)
- Recognizes that "hire great people" is a company priority—this isn't a backfill function, it's a growth engine
- Addresses the tension between speed (unfilled seats cost revenue) and quality (bad hires cost more)
- Thinks about talent as a system, not a series of one-off hires
- Connects employer brand to the specific assets Single Grain has (Eric's brand, Beat Claude, AI culture)
- Second-order thinking: what happens when you hire AI-native people into an agency structure? What cultural tensions arise?

**Red flags:**
- Generic HR playbook that could apply to any company
- Ignores the agency context entirely (margins, client pressure, turnover norms)
- Suggests building a large talent team when budget is one headcount + $3K/month
- Doesn't address the "AI-enabled" requirement beyond surface level
- Treats Beat Claude as a gimmick rather than a strategic asset

### Specificity (25 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Names a specific ATS with reasoning (not just "implement an ATS")
- Actual outreach message templates (not just "write personalized messages")
- Specific interview questions and what they're evaluating
- Named tools with costs (Ashby vs. Greenhouse vs. Lever, and why)
- Onboarding schedule by day/week with actual activities
- Concrete employer brand content ideas (not just "create content")
- Budget breakdown: how does $3K/month get allocated across tools?

**Red flags:**
- "Implement a modern ATS" without naming one
- "Build an employer brand" without describing what that looks like
- "Use AI for screening" without explaining how
- Onboarding section is a list of principles rather than a schedule
- No numbers anywhere (targets, costs, timelines)

### AI Fluency (20 points)

**This challenge is fundamentally about AI-enabled talent management. We want to see:**
- A genuine AI workflow for recruiting—not "use ChatGPT to write job descriptions" but an end-to-end pipeline where AI is integrated at every step
- Understanding of where AI adds real value in talent (sourcing at scale, pattern matching in resumes, personalized outreach, data analysis) vs. where it's dangerous (final hiring decisions, diversity, culture assessment)
- Specific prompt strategies or approaches for talent tasks
- Thoughtful treatment of AI bias in hiring—this is a legal and ethical minefield. Do they know that?
- Ideas for using AI in onboarding and retention (not just recruiting)
- Recognition that the talent function should model the AI culture they're hiring for

**Red flags:**
- AI section reads like a tool wishlist with no workflow
- No mention of bias/fairness concerns in AI-assisted hiring
- Suggests fully automating hiring decisions
- Treats AI as a nice-to-have rather than core to the strategy
- Doesn't connect the company's AI culture to the talent strategy

### Creativity (15 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Non-obvious sourcing channels or strategies (beyond LinkedIn + job boards)
- Creative uses of Eric's content and brand for recruiting
- Innovative assessment ideas beyond standard interviews
- Fresh thinking on agency retention (this is a notoriously hard problem—conventional answers won't score well)
- Ideas for making "Beat Claude" a bigger recruiting flywheel
- Novel approaches to onboarding that leverage AI in ways we haven't seen

**Bonus points for:**
- Ideas that turn the talent function into a marketing asset (recruiting content that also builds the brand)
- Creative retention strategies specific to AI-native professionals
- Unconventional sourcing that taps into communities most recruiters don't reach
- Approaches borrowed from product design (candidate journey mapping, funnel optimization, NPS)

### Communication (10 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Reads like a strategy doc you'd present to the CEO, not an HR textbook
- Clear prioritization—what do you do first, second, third?
- Tables, timelines, and frameworks that make the strategy scannable
- Appropriate level of detail (enough to execute, not so much it's overwhelming)
- Writes about talent the way a business leader thinks about it (revenue impact, ROI, systems) not the way a generic recruiter does (process, compliance, policies)

## Hints for What Beats Claude

Claude's baseline answer covers the fundamentals well:
- Reasonable talent audit
- Competent ATS recommendation (Ashby)
- Standard AI workflow table
- Logical onboarding program
- Sensible metrics and milestones

**To beat it, you might:**
- **Show real agency recruiting experience.** Claude talks about agencies generically. If you've actually hired for agencies, show it—reference real challenges, real solutions, real outcomes
- **Go deeper on AI bias and compliance.** Claude mentions bias briefly. This is a legal and ethical area where depth matters. EEOC implications, adverse impact analysis, state-specific AI hiring laws—show you actually understand the risks
- **Propose a creative sourcing strategy.** Claude suggests LinkedIn + referrals + communities. What's the non-obvious channel? How do you reach AI-native marketers who aren't on LinkedIn Recruiter?
- **Design the Beat Claude flywheel.** Claude mentions promoting it. How do you turn it into a self-sustaining candidate pipeline that grows organically?
- **Get specific on comp strategy.** Claude acknowledges agencies can't match FAANG. But what's the actual comp philosophy? How do you structure offers that win on total value, not just base salary?
- **Address the hard retention problem.** Agency retention is brutal. Claude offers standard advice. If you've solved this problem or seen it solved, show us how
- **Make the onboarding program feel real.** Claude's onboarding is a framework. Design Day 1 hour-by-hour. Design Week 1 session-by-session. Make it so concrete we could run it tomorrow

**Claude's answer tends to be:**
- Comprehensive but reads like a consulting deck
- Correct on AI tools but generic on workflow depth
- Solid on structure but lacks "I've done this before" credibility
- Good framework but not enough "here's exactly what I'd do Monday morning"

The bar to beat is "smart generalist who read about modern recruiting." To win, show us you've actually built talent functions, solved agency-specific hiring problems, and know how to operate AI tools in recruiting—not just theorize about them.
