## Deal Strategy: TechFlow Solutions

### Executive Summary

This deal is stalled because of CFO risk aversion, not budget. The $2M "use it or lose it" budget means money exists. Michael's real objection is implementation risk from his past trauma. The path forward: de-risk the deal for Michael while getting Jennifer (CMO) to provide air cover.

**Close date target:** End of quarter (6 weeks)

---

## 1. Deal Diagnosis

### Why It's Really Stalled

| Surface objection | Real issue |
|-------------------|------------|
| "Wait until next fiscal" | CFO risk aversion, not budget |
| CMO too busy | Sarah hasn't given Jennifer a reason to care |
| Marketo competing on price | Creates convenient excuse to delay |

**The actual blocker:** Michael had a bad MarTech implementation at his previous company. He's afraid of:
1. Implementation disruption
2. Wasted budget if it fails
3. Looking bad to the CEO

**What's missing:** Jennifer (CMO) isn't engaged, so Michael has no executive pressure to move. Sarah is fighting alone.

### Buying Committee Gap

```
Current state:
  Champion (Sarah) ←→ Blocker (CFO)
              ↓
         Stalemate

Needed state:
  Champion (Sarah) + Sponsor (CMO)
              ↓
         Pressure CFO → Deal closes
```

## 2. Stakeholder Strategy

### Jennifer Park (CMO) — Must Engage

**Why she should care:**
- Sarah's project is on OKRs—if it fails, reflects on Jennifer's team
- HubSpot dissatisfaction means marketing is underperforming
- "Use it or lose it" budget—if unspent, her budget shrinks next year

**How to get to her:**

1. **Through Sarah:** "Can you get 15 minutes with Jennifer to share the ROI model? I'll prep a one-pager for her."

2. **Peer-to-peer:** Have my VP of Sales reach out to Jennifer directly: "Jennifer, I understand TechFlow is evaluating marketing platforms. Would love 15 minutes to share what we've done for [Reference Customer]."

3. **Content play:** Send Jennifer a case study of a CMO at a similar company who drove a successful implementation. Make it about her success, not our product.

**Goal:** Get Jennifer to tell Michael "this is a priority, make it happen."

### Michael Torres (CFO) — Neutralize

**What he actually needs:**
- Risk mitigation, not ROI pitch
- Proof this won't blow up
- Contractual protection

**How to address:**

1. **Implementation guarantee:** Offer success-based implementation milestone payments. If we miss milestones, payment deferred.

2. **Reference call:** Connect him with CFO at reference customer who had similar concerns.

3. **Pilot structure:** Propose 90-day success milestone before full deployment (not a discount, a risk-reducer).

4. **Acknowledge his concern:** "Michael, I understand you've seen implementations go sideways. That's exactly why we offer [guarantee]. Can I share how we handled that with [Reference]?"

**Goal:** Make Michael neutral, not a champion. He just needs to not block.

### Alex Wright (CEO) — Only if Necessary

**When to engage:**
- If Jennifer can't move Michael
- If deal is at true impasse in Week 4

**How:**
- Have my VP of Sales request an intro through industry network
- Or: Ask Jennifer to loop Alex in on the strategic importance

**Risk:** Going to CEO without CMO buy-in looks desperate. Save this card.

## 3. Competitive Positioning

### Marketo's 30% Discount

**Don't compete on price.** Compete on risk and outcomes.

**Message:** "Marketo is discounting because they know you're unhappy with HubSpot and they're trying to buy the deal. What happens when implementation goes sideways and there's no discount left to negotiate support?"

**Reframe:** "The question isn't who's cheapest—it's who will still be responsive in Month 6 when you need help. Ask Marketo what their implementation success rate is for companies your size."

### HubSpot Dissatisfaction

**Leverage carefully.** Don't trash-talk; empathize and differentiate.

**Message:** "It sounds like HubSpot's support hasn't met your expectations. That's actually why we assign a dedicated CSM to every account. Here's what that looks like in practice: [specific example]."

**Action:** Get David (RevOps) to document specific HubSpot pain points. Use these in CFO risk conversation: "These are the problems you're solving, and here's how we prevent them."

### Differentiation Message

> "We're not the cheapest option. We're the option that will actually work. Our implementation success rate is [X]%, and we back it with a success-based payment structure. You're not buying software—you're buying a partnership that makes Sarah's team successful."

## 4. Next 10 Actions

| # | Action | Owner | Date | Dependency |
|---|--------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | Prep CMO one-pager (ROI + strategic value) | Me | Day 1 | None |
| 2 | Call Sarah: align on CMO approach | Me | Day 2 | #1 complete |
| 3 | Sarah requests 15-min with Jennifer | Sarah | Day 3 | #2 complete |
| 4 | VP Sales sends peer email to Jennifer | VP | Day 3 | Parallel path |
| 5 | Prep CFO risk mitigation package | Me | Day 4 | None |
| 6 | Request CFO call with reference customer | Me | Day 5 | #5 complete |
| 7 | CMO meeting (if scheduled) | Me + Sarah | Week 2 | #3 or #4 works |
| 8 | CFO reference call | Reference CFO | Week 2 | #6 confirmed |
| 9 | Proposal revision with success milestones | Me | Week 3 | After #7 + #8 |
| 10 | Close call: all stakeholders | Me + VP | Week 4 | All above complete |

### Sequence Logic

```
Week 1: Prep + parallel outreach to CMO
Week 2: CMO meeting + CFO reference call
Week 3: Revised proposal with risk mitigation
Week 4: Final alignment + close
Week 5-6: Buffer for paperwork/legal
```

## 5. Negotiation Strategy

### What I Can Offer

| Concession | Value to them | Cost to us |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Success-based implementation payments | De-risks CFO | Deferred revenue, not lost |
| White-glove onboarding (dedicated CSM) | Faster time-to-value | CS capacity |
| Quarterly payment terms (not annual) | Cash flow flexibility | Minor finance headache |
| 90-day success checkpoint | Psychological safety | Already standard practice |
| 5-10% discount (last resort) | Budget optics | Margin hit |

### What I Ask For In Return

| If they want... | I ask for... |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Quarterly payments | 2-year commitment (not 1) |
| Discount | Case study rights + reference calls |
| Extended pilot | Full contract signed, pilot period |
| Implementation flexibility | Executive sponsor commitment |

### Creating Urgency (Without Being Pushy)

**Legitimate urgency levers:**
1. "Use it or lose it" budget expires in 6 weeks
2. HubSpot renewal in 3 months—switching now avoids double-paying
3. Sarah's OKR deadline
4. Our implementation team has capacity now (may not in Q2)

**How to use:**
> "Jennifer, I want to make sure Sarah's team has this running before your HubSpot renewal. If we kick off implementation in the next 3 weeks, we'll be live in time. After that, the timing gets tight."

## 6. Risk Assessment

### What Could Go Wrong

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| CMO doesn't engage | Medium | VP Sales peer outreach as backup |
| CFO hard blocks regardless | Low | CEO escalation (save for last) |
| Marketo lowers price more | Medium | Don't compete on price—stay on value/risk |
| Legal/procurement delays | Medium | Get MSA started now, parallel path |
| Sarah loses influence | Low | Keep her as sole internal champion |
| Deal slips to next quarter | Medium | Accept gracefully if needed—don't damage relationship |

### Walk-Away Point

If:
- CMO won't engage after 2 weeks of trying
- CFO demands >15% discount
- They want a 6-month free pilot
- They're clearly using us to negotiate Marketo down

Then:
- Gracefully pause: "It sounds like timing isn't right. Let's reconnect when you're closer to HubSpot renewal."
- Don't burn the bridge—this deal could come back in Q2

### If We Lose, We Learn

1. **Why CMO didn't engage:** Was the value prop weak at exec level?
2. **What Michael really feared:** Was it implementation or something else?
3. **How Marketo won:** Was it really price, or did they de-risk better?
4. **Sarah's feedback:** What could we have done differently?

Document everything for next similar deal.

## Summary

This deal is winnable in 6 weeks if we:

1. **Get Jennifer engaged** via Sarah + VP peer outreach
2. **De-risk for Michael** with implementation guarantees and reference calls
3. **Don't compete on price** with Marketo—compete on outcomes
4. **Create legitimate urgency** around budget timing and HubSpot renewal
5. **Execute the 10-action plan** with tight sequencing

The deal is stalled on fear, not budget. Remove the fear, and the budget is already there.
