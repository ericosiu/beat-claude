## Deal Strategy: Reviving a Stalled Enterprise Opportunity

### The Situation

You're an Account Executive at a marketing technology company. You have a stalled deal that leadership wants you to close this quarter.

**Your Company**
- Marketing automation platform
- Mid-market and enterprise focus
- Average deal size: $85K ACV
- Sales cycle: 60-90 days typically

**The Opportunity**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Company | TechFlow Solutions (Series C, $200M valuation) |
| Deal size | $120K ACV (platform + implementation) |
| Stage | Negotiation (Stage 4 of 5) |
| Days in stage | 47 days (avg is 14) |
| Close date | Pushed 3 times, now end of quarter |
| Competition | Incumbent (HubSpot), also talking to Marketo |

**Stakeholders**

| Name | Title | Disposition | Notes |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Sarah Chen | VP Marketing | Champion | Loves your product, drove the eval |
| Michael Torres | CFO | Blocker | Concerned about total cost, wants to wait |
| Jennifer Park | CMO | Neutral | Hasn't been engaged, Sarah's boss |
| David Kim | RevOps Director | Supporter | Did technical eval, prefers your platform |
| Alex Wright | CEO | Unknown | Not involved yet, could overrule CFO |

**Deal History**
- **Week 1-4:** Discovery + demo with Sarah and David. Strong fit identified.
- **Week 5-6:** Technical evaluation. David confirms your API is superior.
- **Week 7-8:** Proposal presented. Sarah excited, asks for executive alignment.
- **Week 9:** CFO joins call. Raises budget concerns. Wants to "wait until next fiscal."
- **Week 10-11:** Sarah tries to get CMO buy-in. CMO too busy, no meeting scheduled.
- **Week 12 (now):** Deal stalled. Sarah says "Michael is blocking, Jennifer won't engage."

**What You Know**
- TechFlow's fiscal year ends in 6 weeks
- They have $2M in "use it or lose it" marketing budget
- HubSpot renewal is in 3 months; they're unhappy with HubSpot support
- Marketo gave them a 30% discount proposal
- Sarah is up for promotion and this project is on her OKRs
- Michael (CFO) just came from a company that had a bad MarTech implementation

**Your Resources**
- Your VP of Sales can join executive calls
- Customer success can offer white-glove onboarding
- You have flexibility on payment terms (not discount)
- Reference customers in their industry (2 similar companies)

### Your Task

**Create a deal strategy** to close this opportunity before end of quarter.

### What to Submit

Your strategy should include:

1. **Deal Diagnosis & Stakeholder Strategy**
   - Why is this deal really stalled? What's the CFO's actual objection?
   - How do you get to the CMO? How do you neutralize the CFO? Should you try for the CEO?
   - How do you handle the Marketo discount and leverage the HubSpot dissatisfaction?

2. **Next 10 Actions**
   - Specific actions with dates
   - Who does what (you, your VP, CS, champion)
   - Sequence and dependencies

3. **Negotiation Strategy & Risk Assessment**
   - What concessions can you offer? What do you ask for in return?
   - How do you create urgency without being pushy?
   - What could still go wrong? What's your walk-away point?

### Constraints

- Cannot discount more than 10% (company policy)
- Must close before end of quarter (your quota)
- Cannot go around Sarah (would damage champion relationship)
- Limited to 2 executive-level meetings before close
