## 90-Day Go-to-Market Strategy

### Executive Summary

With 6 months of runway and strong beta validation (NPS 72, 60% resolution rate), the priority is converting existing momentum into paying customers while building a repeatable acquisition engine. I recommend a focused approach: convert beta users, leverage their success stories, and run targeted outbound to similar companies.

**90-Day Goal:** $50K MRR = ~25 customers at $2K/mo average

---

## 1. Channel Prioritization

### Focus Channels

**1. Beta Conversion (Primary)**
- 50 beta users already using the product
- Goal: Convert 15-20 to paid ($30-40K MRR from this alone)
- Rationale: Warmest leads, proven product-market fit signal

**2. Founder-Led Outbound**
- Founder has 50% bandwidth and Zendesk network
- Target: Companies similar to beta users
- Goal: 10-15 demos/week, 5-10 new customers

**3. Content + SEO (Foundational)**
- Create case studies and comparison content
- Long-term play but establishes credibility
- Goal: Rank for "Zendesk AI automation" type queries

### What We Won't Do

- Paid acquisition (too expensive for unproven funnel)
- Broad brand awareness campaigns
- Conference sponsorships
- Hiring a sales team (premature)

## 2. Budget Allocation ($100K)

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Founder sales enablement | $15K | CRM, email tools, scheduling software |
| Content creation | $20K | 5 case studies, comparison pages, blog posts |
| Fractional demand gen hire | $30K | Part-time marketer to run campaigns |
| Beta conversion incentives | $10K | Discounts for annual commitments |
| Tools & infrastructure | $10K | Analytics, attribution, landing pages |
| Reserve | $15K | Paid ads testing or unexpected needs |

---

## 3. Specific Campaigns

### Campaign 1: Beta-to-Paid Conversion Sprint (Days 1-30)

**Objective:** Convert 15+ beta users to paid

**Tactics:**
- Personal outreach from founder to each beta user
- Offer: 20% discount on annual plan if signed by Day 30
- Create urgency: "Beta period ending, pricing goes up"
- Schedule demos to showcase new features and roadmap

**Success Metrics:**
- 15 conversions ($30K MRR)
- 3 case studies created from converts

### Campaign 2: Lookalike Outbound (Days 15-60)

**Objective:** Acquire 10 net-new customers from outbound

**Tactics:**
- Build list of 500 companies matching beta user profile
- 3-email sequence personalized by support tool used
- Offer: Free 14-day pilot with dedicated support
- Founder handles all sales calls

**Success Metrics:**
- 50 demos booked
- 10 conversions ($20K MRR)

### Campaign 3: Customer Success Content Engine (Days 30-90)

**Objective:** Build credibility and inbound pipeline

**Tactics:**
- Publish 5 case studies with specific metrics
- Create "Zendesk AI" and "Intercom automation" comparison pages
- Guest posts on customer success blogs
- LinkedIn content from founder (3x/week)

**Success Metrics:**
- 10 inbound leads from content
- Rank on page 2 for 3 target keywords

## 4. Pricing Recommendation

### Model: Usage-Based with Seat Minimum

**Structure:**
- Base: $500/mo (includes 1,000 tickets)
- Overage: $0.25/ticket above 1,000
- Typical customer: $1,500-3,000/mo based on volume

### Annual Discount
- 20% discount for annual commitment
- Goal: 60% of new customers on annual plans

### Rationale
- Usage-based aligns with value (cost savings)
- $500 minimum ensures viable unit economics
- Overage pricing rewards product success (more tickets = more value)

### Path to $50K MRR
- 20 customers at $2,500/mo average = $50K MRR
- Slightly conservative vs. 25 at $2K

---

## 5. Key Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Beta users don't convert | Medium | Personal outreach + discounts + urgency |
| Founder bottleneck on sales | High | Document process, consider fractional SDR |
| Competitors undercut on price | Medium | Compete on integration speed (4 hours) |
| Churn from early customers | Low | NPS is strong; add quarterly business reviews |
| $100K budget runs out | Medium | Reserve fund + focus on highest-ROI channels |

- 5 case studies live
- 30+ demos booked from outbound
- Founder sales process documented

### Day 90

## Summary

This strategy bets on the strength of the existing beta cohort and founder's network. Rather than spraying budget across channels, it focuses on:

1. Converting the 50 companies already using the product (highest probability)
2. Replicating success with similar companies via founder-led outbound
3. Building content infrastructure for long-term inbound

The $50K MRR goal is achievable if beta conversion hits 15+ and outbound generates 10+ new customers. The main risk is founder bandwidth—if sales velocity picks up, you'll need to hire.
