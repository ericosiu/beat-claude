## Hints for What Beats Claude

Claude's baseline answer is competent. It covers the basics:
- Beta conversion
- Founder-led outbound
- Content marketing

**To beat it, you might:**
- Go deeper on one area (e.g., specific outbound messaging)
- Challenge an assumption Claude made
- Propose a creative channel Claude didn't consider
- Show stronger financial modeling
- Demonstrate pattern recognition from analogous companies
- Be more specific about execution

**Claude's answer tends to be:**
- Solid but predictable
- Correct but not surprising
- Complete but not inspired

The bar to beat is "competent generalist." To win, show us domain expertise or creative insight that makes Claude's answer look basic.
