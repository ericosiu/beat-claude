# Challenge: Marketing Strategy 001

## Go-to-Market Strategy for AI Customer Support Tool

### The Situation

You're advising a Series A startup that has built an AI-powered customer support tool. Here's what you know:

**Company Snapshot**
- Raised $5M Series A (6 months ago)
- 6 months of runway remaining
- Team: Founder (ex-Zendesk PM) + 2 senior engineers
- No dedicated marketing/sales yet

**Product**
- AI agent that handles Tier 1 customer support tickets
- Integrates with Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk
- Currently resolves 60% of tickets without human intervention
- Reduces support costs by ~40% based on beta data

**Traction**
- 50 companies in beta (free)
- $0 revenue
- Net Promoter Score: 72
- Average integration time: 4 hours

**Market Context**
- Target: B2B SaaS companies with 10-500 employees
- Competitors include established players (Ada, Forethought) and other startups
- Buyers are typically VP of Customer Success or Head of Support

### Your Task

Create a **90-day go-to-market strategy** to get them from $0 to $50K MRR.

### What to Submit

Your strategy should include:

1. **Channel Prioritization & Budget Allocation**
   - Which 2-3 channels will you focus on and why? What will you explicitly NOT do?
   - You have $100K to deploy over 90 days—how do you allocate it across channels, tools, and people?

2. **Specific Campaigns**
   - Describe 3 specific campaigns or initiatives
   - Include expected outcomes and success metrics

3. **Pricing & 90-Day Milestones**
   - What pricing model and price points? How does this support the $50K MRR goal?
   - What should be true at Day 30, 60, and 90?
   - What are the key risks and how do you mitigate them?

### Constraints

- No outbound sales team yet (founder is only salesperson)
- Product is self-serve but complex integrations need hand-holding
- Brand awareness is zero outside of beta users
- Founder can dedicate 50% of time to GTM
