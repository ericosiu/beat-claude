# Challenge: YouTube Strategist 007

## YouTube Growth Strategy for Leveling Up with Eric Siu

### The Situation

You're being hired as the YouTube Strategist for **Leveling Up with Eric Siu** (@LevelingUpOfficial). Your job is to own the channel's growth across both longform and shortform content—and to demonstrate that you think differently than AI.

**Channel Snapshot**
- ~187K subscribers
- ~2,000+ videos published
- ~27.6M lifetime views
- Niche: Marketing, entrepreneurship, AI, business growth
- Host: Eric Siu (CEO of Single Grain, co-host of Marketing School podcast with Neil Patel)
- Content mix: Longform interviews/deep-dives + Shorts/clips
- Monetization is secondary—channel exists to build Eric's personal brand and drive leads to Single Grain

**Current State**
- Longform videos average 2K-8K views
- Shorts are inconsistent in posting cadence and performance
- High-profile guest interviews (Ali Abdaal, Sahil Bloom, Mark Manson) spike views but aren't the norm
- AI and marketing content is the core topic area
- Eric also co-hosts Marketing School (61M+ podcast downloads), so there's a large audience that hasn't migrated to YouTube
- The team is leaning heavily into AI tools internally—this should be reflected in the content strategy

**Competitive Landscape**
- Direct competitors: Neil Patel, Alex Hormozi, Noah Kagan, Pat Flynn, GaryVee
- These channels range from 500K to 4M+ subscribers
- Hormozi's growth playbook (strong hooks, high retention editing, consistent posting) is the benchmark
- AI-focused marketing creators (Matt Wolfe, AI Advantage, Liam Ottley) are growing fast in a parallel niche

### Your Task

Create a **comprehensive YouTube strategy** that demonstrates three things:

1. **Your AI Thinking** — How would you use AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway, ElevenLabs, Opus Clip, vidIQ, etc.) throughout the content pipeline? Don't just mention AI as a buzzword—show us your actual workflow. What do you automate? What stays human? Where does AI give you 10x leverage vs. where does it produce slop?

2. **Your YouTube Strategic Thinking** — Show deep understanding of the YouTube algorithm, audience psychology, and content strategy for both longform (8-20 min) and shortform (< 60 sec). What's the content architecture? How do longform and shortform work together? What does the content calendar look like?

3. **Your Specific Plan for Leveling Up** — Don't give generic YouTube advice. This is for Eric Siu's channel specifically. What would you change? What would you keep? What's the 90-day plan to meaningfully accelerate growth?

### What to Submit

Your strategy should include:

1. **Channel Audit & Diagnosis**
   - What's working on the channel right now?
   - What's broken or underperforming?
   - What's the biggest unlock?

2. **AI-Powered Content Workflow**
   - Map out the end-to-end content pipeline from ideation to publishing
   - Where does AI fit in each step? Be specific about tools and prompts
   - What must remain human-driven and why?

3. **Longform Strategy (8-20 min videos)**
   - Content pillars and topic selection framework
   - Title/thumbnail philosophy
   - Scripting and structure approach
   - Posting cadence and ideal publish times
   - 10 specific video ideas with titles and hook lines

4. **Shortform Strategy (YouTube Shorts)**
   - Where do Shorts come from? (Original vs. repurposed)
   - Hook methodology for <3 second retention
   - Posting cadence
   - How Shorts feed the longform funnel
   - 10 specific Shorts concepts

5. **Growth Playbook**
   - How do you get from 187K to 500K subscribers?
   - What are the 3 biggest growth levers?
   - How do you leverage Eric's existing audience (podcast, LinkedIn, newsletter)?
   - Collaboration and guest strategy

6. **90-Day Milestones**
   - What should be true at Day 30, 60, and 90?
   - What KPIs are you tracking weekly?
   - What does success look like?

### Constraints

- Eric can dedicate 4-6 hours/week to filming (he runs two companies)
- Budget for editor + thumbnail designer is $5K-8K/month
- The channel must serve Single Grain's brand (lead gen for the agency)
- Content should position Eric as a thought leader in AI + marketing
- Team currently: 1 video editor, 1 social media coordinator
- No clickbait that damages credibility—Eric's brand is "smart, data-driven, no BS"

### Evaluation Criteria

See [SCORING.md](../../SCORING.md) for how submissions are evaluated.

Your answer will be compared against Claude's answer to this same brief in a blind review.

**This challenge specifically weights:**
- AI Fluency (20 pts) — We want to see you actually understand AI workflows, not just name-drop tools
- Creativity (15 pts) — YouTube is a creative medium. Generic "post consistently and optimize thumbnails" advice won't cut it
- Specificity (25 pts) — Give us video titles, hook lines, thumbnail concepts. Could we execute this tomorrow?

### Format

Submit as PDF or Markdown. No length requirement—be as concise or detailed as the strategy demands.
