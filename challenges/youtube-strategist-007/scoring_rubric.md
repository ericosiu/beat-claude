# Scoring Rubric: YouTube Strategist 007

This challenge-specific rubric supplements the [general scoring methodology](../../SCORING.md).

## Challenge-Specific Evaluation Points

### Strategic Depth (30 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Understands that Eric's limited filming time is THE constraint—strategy must work within 4-6 hrs/week
- Recognizes the podcast-to-YouTube audience migration opportunity (61M podcast downloads vs. 187K YT subs)
- Addresses the longform/shortform flywheel—not just "post both" but how they feed each other
- Thinks about YouTube as a lead gen channel for Single Grain, not just a vanity metric play
- Second-order thinking: what happens when Shorts bring in subscribers who don't care about longform?

**Red flags:**
- Suggests Eric film daily or increase filming time significantly
- Ignores the podcast/newsletter audience entirely
- Treats Shorts and longform as independent strategies
- Focuses only on subscriber count without connecting to business outcomes
- Generic "just be consistent" advice

### Specificity (25 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Actual video titles and hook lines, not just "make better titles"
- Named AI tools with specific use cases (not just "use AI for editing")
- Thumbnail descriptions or concepts, not just "make better thumbnails"
- Specific posting schedule with days/times
- Real competitor analysis—references actual videos/creators with specifics
- Budget allocation across the small-team budget

**Red flags:**
- "Create a content calendar" without showing what's on it
- "Optimize thumbnails" without describing what good looks like
- AI section is just a list of tool names without workflow detail
- No concrete video ideas

### AI Fluency (20 points)

**This challenge weights AI fluency heavily. We want to see:**
- A genuine AI content workflow—not theory but "here's what I'd actually do"
- Understanding of where AI excels (research, repurposing, SEO, scripting outlines) vs. where it fails (creative judgment, Eric's voice, authentic stories)
- Specific prompt strategies or approaches, not just "use Claude to write scripts"
- Recognition that AI-generated content needs human editing to avoid sameness
- Ideas for AI-native content formats (live demos, tool comparisons, workflow walkthroughs)
- Forward-thinking about AI video tools (Runway, Sora, etc.) and where they're actually useful vs. hype

**Red flags:**
- Lists AI tools without explaining how they fit the workflow
- Suggests fully automating content creation
- Treats AI as a magic solution with no quality control
- No mention of AI despite it being a core ask

### Creativity (15 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Non-obvious content formats or series ideas
- Creative ways to leverage Eric's unique assets (agency data, client stories, poker background, gaming background)
- Unconventional growth tactics beyond "post Shorts and optimize thumbnails"
- Pattern recognition from channels outside the marketing niche
- Fresh takes on how to differentiate from Hormozi/Patel/GaryVee

**Bonus points for:**
- Ideas that make us say "why hasn't anyone done this?"
- Creative uses of AI that go beyond standard suggestions
- Content concepts that only Eric could execute (unique to his background/access)
- Novel approaches to the podcast-to-YouTube conversion problem

### Communication (10 points)

**What we're looking for:**
- Organized like a real strategy doc, not a brain dump
- Visual thinkers get bonus points (mockup thumbnails, content calendar layouts, workflow diagrams)
- Right level of detail—deep enough to execute, concise enough to read in 15 minutes
- Clear prioritization of what to do first vs. later

## Hints for What Beats Claude

Claude's baseline answer is solid. It covers:
- Reasonable channel audit
- Standard AI tool workflow
- Decent content pillar structure
- Logical Shorts strategy
- Plausible growth projections

**To beat it, you might:**
- **Show deeper YouTube-specific expertise.** Claude gives good general strategy but misses YouTube-specific mechanics (browse features, suggested video optimization, watch-time signals, audience tab insights)
- **Propose a creative content format** Claude didn't think of. A recurring series, a challenge concept, a unique collaboration format
- **Go deeper on AI workflow.** Claude lists tools in a table. Show us your actual workflow—screen-by-screen if you want. What prompts do you use? How do you quality-control AI output?
- **Bring data.** Analyze Eric's actual recent videos. Pull CTR benchmarks. Reference specific competitor videos that worked and why
- **Address the real tension:** Eric has 4-6 hrs/week. How do you get maximum output from that? Claude's answer says "batch film" but doesn't design the batch session
- **Show personality.** Claude's answer is correct but dry. If you can communicate strategy in a way that's also engaging to read, that separates you

**Claude's answer tends to be:**
- Comprehensive but surface-level on YouTube mechanics
- Reasonable but predictable on content ideas
- Smart but generic on AI workflow
- Correct but not inspired on growth strategy

The bar to beat is "competent YouTube consultant who read a few blog posts." To win, show us you've actually grown channels, understand the algorithm deeply, and can think creatively about content—not just strategically.
