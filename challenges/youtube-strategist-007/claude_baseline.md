## YouTube Growth Strategy for Leveling Up with Eric Siu

### Executive Summary

Leveling Up has a strong foundation—187K subscribers, a recognizable host, and a built-in audience from Marketing School and LinkedIn. But the channel is underperforming its potential. The core issue: content is optimized for "getting videos out" rather than "getting videos watched." The fix requires tighter topic selection, better packaging (titles + thumbnails), a deliberate longform/shortform flywheel, and AI integration across the pipeline to maximize output from Eric's limited filming time.

**90-Day Goal:** Increase average longform views from ~5K to 15K+ and grow from 187K to 210K+ subscribers through higher CTR, better retention, and a consistent Shorts engine.

---

## 1. Channel Audit & Diagnosis

### What's Working
- **Eric's credibility is real.** Running Single Grain, co-hosting with Neil Patel, interviewing names like Ali Abdaal and Sahil Bloom—this is a genuine authority channel
- **Topic relevance.** AI + marketing is one of the fastest-growing content niches
- **Volume.** 2,000+ videos means the channel has deep catalog value for search
- **Guest episodes spike views.** High-profile guests reliably pull 20K-50K+ views

### What's Broken
- **Titles and thumbnails are underpackaged.** Many videos use descriptive titles ("How We Built X") rather than curiosity-driven ones ("This AI Tool Replaced Our Entire Marketing Team")
- **No clear content pillars.** The channel mixes interviews, solo commentary, tactical tutorials, and podcast clips without a predictable structure viewers can subscribe to
- **Shorts are an afterthought.** Inconsistent posting, no native Shorts strategy—just occasional clips
- **First 30 seconds don't hook.** Many videos open with intros and context instead of leading with the payoff
- **Podcast audience hasn't migrated.** 61M podcast downloads but 187K YouTube subscribers means there's a massive conversion gap

### Biggest Unlock
**Packaging + Shorts flywheel.** The content substance is already good. The problem is discoverability. Better titles/thumbnails on longform (2-3x CTR improvement) combined with a daily Shorts engine (driving browse traffic and new subscribers) would compound growth significantly.

## 2. AI-Powered Content Workflow

### End-to-End Pipeline

| Stage | AI Tool | What It Does | Human Role |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Ideation** | Claude / ChatGPT | Analyze trending topics, generate title variations, research competitors' top videos | Eric picks topics based on personal conviction and expertise |
| **Research** | Claude + Perplexity | Pull stats, case studies, and data points for each video topic | Team validates accuracy |
| **Scripting** | Claude | Generate outline with hook options, key points, and CTA structure | Eric rewrites in his voice, adds personal stories |
| **Thumbnail** | Midjourney + Canva | Generate background concepts, test face expressions against templates | Designer makes final creative decisions |
| **Filming** | Teleprompter app | Display script/bullet points during recording | Eric delivers—personality is irreplaceable |
| **Editing** | Opus Clip + Descript | Auto-generate Shorts candidates, remove filler, create rough cuts | Editor does final pacing, music, graphics |
| **SEO** | vidIQ + TubeBuddy | Tag optimization, title testing, competitor gap analysis | Strategist reviews and approves |
| **Publishing** | Claude | Write descriptions, timestamps, generate social copy for cross-promotion | Team schedules and distributes |
| **Analytics** | Claude + YouTube Studio | Weekly performance reports, identify patterns in what's working | Strategist interprets and adjusts strategy |

### What Must Stay Human
- **Eric's delivery and personality.** This is a personal brand channel. AI-generated voiceovers or faceless content would destroy trust
- **Topic conviction.** Eric should only make videos about things he genuinely believes and has experience with
- **Creative judgment on thumbnails.** AI can generate options, but the "would I click this?" instinct is human
- **Guest selection.** Relationships and reputation matter—this can't be automated

### Where AI Gives 10x Leverage
- **Repurposing.** One 15-minute longform video becomes 5-7 Shorts, a LinkedIn post, a newsletter section, and a Twitter thread—mostly automated
- **Title/thumbnail testing.** Generate 20 title options in seconds instead of brainstorming for an hour
- **Research speed.** What used to take a VA 3 hours takes Claude 5 minutes
- **Description + SEO.** Fully automatable, no quality loss

## 3. Longform Strategy (8-20 Min Videos)

### Content Pillars

1. **AI Marketing Playbooks** — Tactical "how I used AI to do X" videos. Example: "I Used Claude to Write 50 Blog Posts in a Day—Here's What Happened"
2. **Founder Lessons** — Hard-won business lessons from running Single Grain. Example: "I Almost Lost My Agency. Here's How I Saved It."
3. **Expert Interviews** — High-profile guests with a strong hook. Example: "Neil Patel Told Me His #1 SEO Strategy for 2026"
4. **Industry Analysis** — Hot takes and trend breakdowns. Example: "Google's AI Search Is Killing SEO—Here's What to Do Instead"

### Title/Thumbnail Philosophy
- **Title formula:** [Emotional hook] + [Specific outcome] + [Curiosity gap]
- Examples:
  - "This Free AI Tool Gets More Leads Than a $10K/mo Agency"
  - "I Analyzed 1,000 YouTube Channels. Here's Why Most Fail."
  - "Stop Making YouTube Shorts (Do This Instead)"
- **Thumbnail rules:**
  - Eric's face with clear emotion (surprise, skepticism, excitement)
  - Maximum 4 words of text
  - High contrast colors (avoid dull backgrounds)
  - Before/after or "vs" compositions when applicable

### Scripting & Structure
Every longform video follows this framework:
1. **Hook (0-15 sec):** Lead with the most surprising/valuable claim. No intros, no "hey guys"
2. **Setup (15-60 sec):** Establish why this matters and what the viewer will learn
3. **Body (3-5 sections):** Each section delivers one key point with examples
4. **Retention bumps:** Every 2-3 minutes, tease what's coming next ("but the third strategy is what really changed everything")
5. **CTA (last 30 sec):** Subscribe + "watch this next" pointing to a related video

### Posting Cadence
- **2 longform videos per week** (Tuesday + Thursday at 8am ET)
- Filming: Eric batches 4 videos in one 4-hour session every 2 weeks
- This respects the 4-6 hr/week filming constraint

### 10 Specific Video Ideas

| # | Title | Hook Line |
|---|-------|-----------|
| 1 | "I Replaced My Marketing Team with Claude Code (Here's the Truth)" | "Last month I fired up Claude Code and had it build systems that took my team weeks. But here's what nobody tells you about using AI to run marketing..." |
| 2 | "The YouTube Strategy That Took Alex Hormozi from 0 to 3M Subscribers" | "Alex Hormozi grew faster than almost anyone on YouTube. I broke down exactly what he did—and most of it has nothing to do with content quality." |
| 3 | "Google Is Dead for Marketers. Here's What Replaces It." | "I've spent 12 years building businesses on Google. And for the first time, I'm telling my clients to prepare for a world where Google isn't the #1 traffic source." |
| 4 | "How I'd Build a $1M Agency in 2026 (Starting from Zero)" | "If I lost everything tomorrow and had to rebuild Single Grain from scratch, here's the exact playbook I'd follow." |
| 5 | "I Tested 7 AI Video Tools So You Don't Have To" | "Everyone's saying AI will replace video editors. I actually tested the top 7 tools on real content. Three were shockingly good. Four were useless." |
| 6 | "Why 90% of Marketing Agencies Will Die by 2028" | "The marketing agency model is broken and most agency owners don't see it coming. Here's what's about to change and how to survive." |
| 7 | "Neil Patel's Private Strategy for 2026 (He Told Me Not to Share This)" | "I sat down with Neil off-camera and he walked me through what he's actually doing to grow traffic in 2026. It's the opposite of what he says on his channel." |
| 8 | "The $0 Marketing Stack That Outperforms $50K/mo Agencies" | "My team built an AI marketing stack that costs nothing and outperforms what most companies pay $50K/month for. I'll show you every tool." |
| 9 | "I Read 100 Business Books. Only 5 Were Worth It." | "I've read over 100 business books in the last decade. Most are filler. These 5 actually changed how I run my companies." |
| 10 | "How to Get 100K YouTube Subscribers (What Actually Works in 2026)" | "I've spent 10 years on YouTube and made every mistake. Here's the only growth playbook that actually works right now." |

---

## 4. Shortform Strategy (YouTube Shorts)

### Source Mix
- **60% repurposed from longform** — Best clips pulled via Opus Clip, then re-edited with native hooks
- **30% original Shorts** — Quick takes, hot takes, and "one thing" tips filmed in batch sessions
- **10% trending reactions** — Quick response to industry news or viral content

### Hook Methodology (<3 Seconds)
Every Short must pass the "scroll-stop" test:
- **Pattern interrupt:** Start with a bold claim, unexpected visual, or direct address
- **Formats that work:**
  - "Stop doing [common thing]..."
  - "The #1 reason [bad outcome]..."
  - "Nobody talks about this..."
  - "[Number] [thing] that [unexpected result]"
  - "I just found out [surprising fact]..."
- First frame must have on-screen text reinforcing the hook

### Posting Cadence
- **1-2 Shorts per day, 7 days a week**
- Scheduled via YouTube Studio
- Weekend Shorts can be lighter/personal

### How Shorts Feed Longform
- Every Short ends with: "Full breakdown on my channel" (drives profile visits)
- Shorts topics test what resonates—high-performing Short topics become longform videos
- Shorts bring in new subscribers who then get served longform in their feed

### 10 Specific Shorts Concepts

| # | Concept | Hook |
|---|---------|------|
| 1 | "The AI tool marketers are sleeping on" | "This tool costs $0 and does what agencies charge $5K/month for." |
| 2 | "What I'd do with $1K in marketing budget" | "If I only had $1,000 to market a business, here's exactly where I'd spend it." |
| 3 | "Why your YouTube thumbnails suck" | "I looked at 50 small channels yesterday. They all make the same thumbnail mistake." |
| 4 | "The hiring test that filters 90% of candidates" | "We make every candidate compete against Claude. Most people lose." |
| 5 | "One SEO trick that still works in 2026" | "Every SEO guru says SEO is dead. They're wrong—but only if you do this." |
| 6 | "How to get a meeting with anyone" | "I've gotten meetings with billionaires. This is the exact template I use." |
| 7 | "The agency model is dying" | "If you run a marketing agency and you're not building software, you have 2 years." |
| 8 | "AI replaced this entire job" | "We used to pay $6K/month for this. Now Claude does it in 10 minutes." |
| 9 | "The worst marketing advice on the internet" | "I keep seeing this advice everywhere and it's destroying businesses." |
| 10 | "How I'd grow on YouTube starting today" | "Forget everything you've heard. There are only 3 things that matter." |

## 5. Growth Playbook

### Path from 187K to 500K

**The math:**
- Current growth: ~2-3K subs/month (organic, slow)
- Target: ~10-12K subs/month sustained
- Timeline: 18-24 months to 500K at that rate

### 3 Biggest Growth Levers

**1. Packaging Overhaul (Biggest Impact)**
- Hire a title/thumbnail specialist or train the existing designer
- A/B test thumbnails using YouTube's built-in feature
- Study top performers in the niche weekly—reverse-engineer what's getting clicks
- Expected impact: 2-3x CTR improvement = 2-3x views on the same content

**2. Shorts Engine (New Subscriber Acquisition)**
- Daily Shorts bring the channel into YouTube's browse/recommendation algorithm
- Shorts subscribers convert to longform viewers at ~10-15% rate
- At 1-2/day, expect 3-5K new subs/month from Shorts alone
- Expected impact: 50-70% of new subscriber growth

**3. Cross-Platform Audience Migration**
- Marketing School podcast: Add YouTube-specific CTAs ("watch the video version on Leveling Up")
- LinkedIn (Eric has strong presence): Post video clips natively with "full video on YouTube" CTAs
- Newsletter: Embed latest YouTube video in every issue
- Expected impact: Convert 5-10% of existing audience to YouTube subscribers over 6 months

### Collaboration & Guest Strategy
- **Monthly "big name" interviews:** One marquee guest per month (aim for Hormozi, Iman Gadzhi, Mr. Beast team members, SaaS founders)
- **Bi-weekly "rising star" features:** Interview creators with 50K-200K subs—they share the content, introducing Eric to their audience
- **Reaction/response content:** When a big creator makes a claim about marketing or AI, Eric reacts with his take (piggybacks on their search volume)

## Summary

The Leveling Up channel has strong fundamentals—credible host, relevant topics, existing audience. The gap is execution: better packaging, consistent Shorts, and a systematic AI-powered content pipeline. The strategy prioritizes high-leverage changes (titles, thumbnails, Shorts) over expensive bets (paid promotion, studio upgrades). With disciplined execution, 500K subscribers within 18-24 months is realistic.
