# Claude's Baseline Answer: General 000

> Note: This is Claude's response to the same challenge. Applicant submissions are scored against this in blind review.

## Part 1: The Role I Want

I'd want to work as an **AI Operations Strategist** — someone who sits between the technical AI implementation and the business outcomes it's supposed to drive.

**What I'd own:** Identifying which workflows across the agency can be automated or augmented with AI, building the systems to do it, and measuring whether they actually move revenue. Not just "we use AI now" but "this AI system generated $X in measurable value this quarter."

**First 90 days:**
- Days 1-30: Audit every department's workflows. Map which tasks are repetitive, which require judgment, and which are a mix. Identify the 3-5 highest-ROI automation opportunities.
- Days 31-60: Build and ship the top 2 automations. Instrument them to track time saved, quality maintained, and revenue influenced.
- Days 61-90: Measure results, document playbooks, and present the ROI case for scaling. Propose the next quarter's automation roadmap based on actual data.

**Why Single Grain:** The TES transition is the interesting bet. Most agencies are bolting AI onto the same business model. Single Grain is trying to change the model itself — from selling hours to selling outcomes powered by AI. That's a fundamentally different problem and a more interesting one.

## Part 2: Proof of Exceptional Ability

**Disclaimer: I'm an AI. I don't have real work history. This is what a strong answer would look like structurally — but every claim below is hypothetical. A real applicant's advantage is that their examples are verifiable and mine aren't.**

**Example 1 — Workflow Automation:**
Built an automated content optimization pipeline that analyzed 500+ blog posts against search performance data, identified posts with decaying traffic, generated refresh recommendations, and prioritized them by revenue impact. Previously required 2 analysts spending 15 hours/week. System runs autonomously and surfaces the top 10 opportunities each Monday morning.

Result: 23% increase in organic traffic from refreshed content over 6 months. Team reallocated 30 hours/week to higher-leverage work.

**Example 2 — AI-Augmented Client Strategy:**
Developed a system that ingests client call transcripts, CRM data, and campaign performance to generate pre-meeting strategy briefs. Each brief includes churn risk signals, upsell opportunities, and talking points backed by actual performance data.

Result: Account managers report saving 45 minutes of prep per client meeting. Client retention improved 12% in the first quarter after deployment.

**Example 3 — Operational Efficiency:**
Created a reporting system that replaces manual monthly client reports. Pulls from GA4, GSC, ad platforms, and CRM data. Generates narrative summaries, highlights anomalies, and recommends next actions.

Result: Reduced reporting time from 4 hours per client to 20 minutes of review. Freed up 60+ hours/month across the account team.

## Part 3: My AI Edge

**1. My AI Stack:**
As an AI, my "stack" is myself. But if I were a human professional in 2026, a strong AI stack would look like: Claude Code for multi-agent research and content production, custom MCP servers connecting to business data (GA4, GSC, CRM), Cursor or similar for code-assisted development, and purpose-built automations for repetitive analysis workflows. The key isn't the tools — it's whether they're integrated into daily work or just installed and occasionally opened.

**2. Best AI Win:**
Again, I can't cite a real one. A strong answer here would describe a specific project where AI wasn't just a helper but fundamentally changed what was possible — something that couldn't have been done at all without AI, not just done faster.

**3. What Changes by 2028:**
In digital marketing specifically:
- **Disappears:** Manual reporting, basic content writing, routine technical SEO audits, simple ad campaign management. These become features of tools, not job descriptions.
- **Emerges:** AI operations roles (building and maintaining agent systems), prompt engineering as a core marketing skill, "AI taste" — the ability to evaluate and improve AI output — becomes as valued as "data literacy" is today.
- **Becomes table stakes:** Using AI for content production, automated A/B testing, real-time campaign optimization. Companies that aren't doing this by 2028 are already behind.
- **Current advantage that commoditizes:** Having any AI workflow at all. Right now, just using AI tools is a differentiator. By 2028, it's expected. The new advantage is having AI systems that are customized, integrated, and compounding.

*Note to reviewers: The structural weakness of this baseline is intentional. Claude cannot provide verifiable evidence of real work. Any applicant who submits genuine proof of exceptional results — with real numbers, real links, real artifacts — automatically differentiates from this answer. That's the point of the challenge.*
