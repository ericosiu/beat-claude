# Challenge: General 000

## The Open Challenge

**This challenge is for anyone.** Don't see your role listed? This is your way in. We're looking for people with exceptional abilities who want to work at the intersection of AI and marketing.

### About Single Grain

Single Grain is a digital marketing agency that works with companies like Amazon, Uber, and Salesforce. We're transitioning from a traditional agency to a tech-enabled services (TES) company — AI agents handle the repetitive work, humans do the thinking that AI can't.

We use Claude Code, custom AI agents, and automation across every department. If you're not already working with AI daily, this probably isn't the right fit.

### Your Submission

Your submission has three parts. All three are required.

---

## Part 1: The Role You Want

Tell us what you want to do here. This isn't a dropdown menu — describe it in your own words.

- What kind of work do you want to own?
- What would your first 90 days look like?
- Why Single Grain specifically, and why now?

If it maps to one of our [role-specific challenges](../), feel free to do that one instead (or both). This challenge exists for people whose best work doesn't fit neatly into a job title.

## Part 2: Proof of Exceptional Ability

This is the core of your submission. We need **evidence** — not claims.

Show us 2-3 examples of work you've done that demonstrate you're exceptional at what you do. "Exceptional" means results that most people in your field couldn't produce.

**What counts as proof:**

- **Numbers.** "I took organic traffic from 40K to 400K in 8 months" with the receipts to back it up. Screenshots, links, case studies.
- **Work samples.** A campaign you built, a system you designed, code you shipped, content that performed. Link to it or include it.
- **Before/after.** Show us what something looked like before you touched it and after. The delta is what we're evaluating.
- **AI-specific results.** Built an agent that replaced a manual workflow? Automated something that used to take a team 20 hours/week? Show us. This carries extra weight.

**What doesn't count:**

- "I'm a hard worker and a fast learner"
- Responsibilities without outcomes ("managed a team of 5")
- Vague claims without evidence ("significantly improved performance")

### Examples of What Exceptional Looks Like

These are real examples of the caliber we're looking for (anonymized):

**Example A — Growth Marketer:**
> "I built a programmatic SEO system that generated 12,000 pages targeting long-tail keywords. Within 6 months, those pages drove 180K monthly organic visits and $40K/month in attributed pipeline. Here's the architecture, here's the traffic curve, here's the keyword strategy."

**Example B — Engineer:**
> "I built an AI agent system that processes 200+ client SEO audits per week, replacing what previously took 3 analysts 40 hours each. The system catches 94% of the issues human auditors catch, plus 15% they typically miss. Here's the repo, here's the accuracy benchmarks."

**Example C — Strategist:**
> "I identified that a $2M/year client was about to churn 6 weeks before they told us, based on engagement pattern changes I noticed. I redesigned their strategy, presented it unprompted, and retained the account for another 18 months ($3M total). Here's the deck I presented and the before/after metrics."

Notice the pattern: **specific numbers, real artifacts, clear cause-and-effect.**

## Part 3: Your AI Edge

We're an AI-forward company. This section is about how you work with AI today and how you think about where it's going.

Answer these:

1. **Your AI stack.** What AI tools do you use daily? Not a list — tell us *how* you use them and what they've changed about your output. Be specific. "I use ChatGPT" tells us nothing. "I use Claude Code to run 5 parallel research agents that produce deliverables my team used to spend 3 days on" tells us a lot.

2. **Your best AI win.** Describe one specific time you used AI to produce a result that wouldn't have been possible (or would have taken 10x longer) without it. What was the task? What did you build/do? What was the outcome?

3. **What changes in the next 2 years.** Pick your field and tell us what AI does to it by 2028. Not generic "AI will transform everything" — specific predictions. What jobs disappear? What new roles emerge? What becomes table stakes that's currently a competitive advantage? We want your honest read, not the optimistic version.

## What We're Evaluating

| Criterion | Weight | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| Evidence of exceptional ability | 40% | Real proof, real numbers, real artifacts. Could we verify this? |
| AI fluency and vision | 25% | Do you actually use AI at a high level, or just talk about it? |
| Self-awareness and fit | 15% | Do you know what you're great at and where you'd plug in here? |
| Communication quality | 10% | Clear, concise, no fluff. Respects the reader's time. |
| Non-obvious insight | 10% | Did you show us something we haven't seen before? |

## What Will Lose

- Generic AI hype without personal evidence
- Impressive-sounding claims with no proof
- Answers that are clearly just Claude's output with light editing
- Playing it safe or being comprehensive instead of being specific

## What Will Win

- Submissions where we can verify the results
- Someone who has clearly been building with AI, not just reading about it
- Specificity that could only come from someone who actually did the work
- The confidence to say "here's what I'm great at" and back it up

## Format

Anything works. PDF, Markdown, Notion page, personal site, video walkthrough, code repo. We don't care about the container — we care about what's inside.

**Maximum 4 pages.** If you can make your case in 2 pages, don't write 4. Estimated time: 1-2 hours.

## Evaluation

Your submission is scored alongside Claude's baseline answer in a blind review. See [SCORING.md](../../SCORING.md) for the general rubric.

For this challenge, we're also applying the **Dinner Test:**

> "Would we want to have a 2-hour conversation with this person?"

If yes — you advance to a conversation regardless of score (as long as you're above 50).
