# Scoring Methodology

## How We Evaluate

All submissions go through **blind review**. The reviewer sees:
- Claude's answer (labeled "Submission A")
- Your answer (labeled "Submission B", "C", etc.)

The reviewer doesn't know which is Claude's until after scoring.

## Scoring Criteria (100 points)

### Strategic Depth — 30 points

Does the answer demonstrate real strategic thinking?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 25-30 | Addresses constraints explicitly, sound reasoning, clear assumptions, considers second-order effects |
| 15-24 | Good reasoning but misses some constraints or makes unstated assumptions |
| 5-14 | Surface-level strategy, obvious recommendations, limited reasoning |
| 0-4 | Generic advice that could apply to any company |

### Specificity — 25 points

Could you execute this tomorrow?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 20-25 | Concrete numbers, specific timelines, named tools/channels, actionable steps |
| 12-19 | Some specifics but gaps in execution detail |
| 5-11 | Vague recommendations, missing timelines or budgets |
| 0-4 | Purely conceptual, no actionable detail |

### AI Fluency — 20 points

Does the answer show understanding of AI's role in modern marketing?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 16-20 | Leverages AI capabilities intelligently, forward-thinking about automation, understands limitations |
| 10-15 | Mentions AI appropriately but doesn't deeply integrate it |
| 4-9 | Treats AI as an afterthought or checkbox |
| 0-3 | Ignores AI entirely or shows outdated thinking |

### Creativity — 15 points

Does the answer contain non-obvious insights?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 12-15 | Unique angles, pattern recognition from other industries, contrarian-but-sound ideas |
| 7-11 | Some fresh thinking but mostly conventional |
| 3-6 | Entirely conventional playbook |
| 0-2 | Copy-paste thinking, no original insight |

### Communication — 10 points

Is it clear, concise, and executive-ready?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 8-10 | Scannable, logical flow, appropriate detail level, professional formatting |
| 5-7 | Readable but some organization issues |
| 2-4 | Difficult to follow, buried lead, poor structure |
| 0-1 | Confusing, unprofessional, or rambling |

## Winning Threshold

To "beat Claude," your score must be **higher than Claude's score** on the same challenge.

If scores are within 5 points (tie territory), we may:
- Request a follow-up response to a curveball question
- Schedule a brief call to discuss your thinking
- Review both answers with a second reviewer

## What We're Really Looking For

The scoring rubric is a tool, not a formula. What actually matters:

1. **Would we trust this person to own a client engagement?**
2. **Did they see something Claude missed?**
3. **Do they make AI look basic, or do they sound like AI?**

## Review Process

1. **Anonymization**: Names removed, submissions labeled A/B/C
2. **Scoring**: Reviewer scores each on the 5 criteria
3. **Comparison**: Scores tallied, Claude's revealed
4. **Decision**: Beat Claude → advance to interview

## Format & Length

All challenges have a **4-page maximum** (diagrams and wireframes don't count toward the limit). This is clearly stated in each challenge brief.

**Reviewers will not penalize submissions for length** as long as they stay within the stated limit. A focused 2-page submission can absolutely beat a 4-page one—we score on quality, not volume.

Submissions that exceed 4 pages will still be reviewed, but excessive length may affect Communication scores if it signals poor prioritization.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I tie with Claude?**

Ties don't advance automatically. We may ask a follow-up question or schedule a quick call.

**Q: How long until I hear back?**

Within 2 weeks. We review submissions in batches.

**Q: Can I resubmit?**

One submission per challenge. If you want another shot, wait for a new challenge.

**Q: Who reviews submissions?**

Single Grain team members with domain expertise in the challenge area.

**Q: How long should this take?**

Most challenges are designed to take 1-2 hours. If you're spending significantly more, you may be over-thinking it. We're testing judgment and prioritization, not endurance.
